using time series data. This enables the user to estimate evapotranspiration 
and calibrate the models with just a few lines of python code.  

In the current version, PyEt supports the next methods to calculate ET:
* Penman-Monteith (Monteith, 1965; FAO, 1990; ASCE, 2005)
* FAO-56 Penman-Monteith (Monteith, 1965; Allen et al, 1998)
