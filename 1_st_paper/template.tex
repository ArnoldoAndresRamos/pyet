\section{Introduction}

\section{Evaluation of PET models}

\subsection{Previous research}
Sensitivity to erros in potential evapotranspiration input \cite{parmele1972errors}
\cite{parmele1974comparisons} and \cite{mcguinness1972comparison}(z0 = 1 for meadow grass)(details of computation)(Blaney-Criddle-only mean T, Jensen-Hasie \cite{jensen1963estimating}-solar radiation with T) compared 9 PET methods using onsite meteo data
(PEnman with empirical wind function applicable to a short grass with rougness coef of 1cm): 
\cite{andreassian2004impact}-sensitivty of PEnman
\begin{equation}
f(u)=0.35+0.0035*u_2
\end{equation}


\subsection{Evaluation of PET models with default coefficients}
same Rn same rh same T...

Penman 
\begin{equation}
E = \frac{1}{\lambda \rho_w} \frac{\Delta (R_{n}-G) + K_u \gamma(a_w+b_wu_2)(e_{s}-e_{a})}{\Delta +\gamma}
\end{equation}
where $a_w$ and $b_w$ are wind function coefficients that are usually receive a local or regional calibration.
Parameter $K_u$ =6.43 for ET in mmd$^{-1}$ and $K_u$ =0.268 for ET in mmhour$^{-1}$.
Penman \cite{penman1963vegetation} used for clipped grass \cite{asce2005asce} $a_w$ = 1.0 and $b_w$ = 0.537, respectively,for wind speed in ms $^{-1}$, $es-ea$ in kPa and grass ETo in mmd$^{-1}$. The equations were intended for use with daily computations. In application of the 1963 Penman, saturation vapor pressure is traditionally based on mean daily air temperature rather than on Tmax and Tmin$"$ \cite{jensen1990evapotranspiration}.



Penman-Monteith \cite{asce2005asce}
\begin{equation}
E = \frac{1}{\lambda} \frac{\Delta (R_{n}-G)+ \rho_a c_p  (e_{s}-e_{a})/r_{ah}}{\left[ \Delta +\gamma (1+\frac{r_s}{r_{ah}})\right]}
\end{equation}

Priestley-Taylor \cite{asce2005asce}
\begin{equation}
E = \frac{1.26}{\lambda} \frac{\Delta}{\Delta +\gamma}(R_{n}-G)
\end{equation}

Kimberley-Penman \cite{asce2005asce}
\begin{equation}
E = \frac{1}{\lambda \rho_w} \frac{\Delta (R_{n}-G) + K_u \gamma(a_w+b_wu_2)(e_{s}-e_{a})}{\Delta +\gamma} 
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{equation}
a_w = 0.4 + 1.4 exp{-\left[\left(\frac{J-173}{58}\right)^2\right]}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
b_w = 0.605 + 0.345 exp{-\left[\left(\frac{J-243}{80}\right)^2\right]}
\end{equation}
Hamon

Turc--

Makink (default) \cite{asce2005asce}
\begin{equation}
ET_0 = 0.61 \frac{\Delta}{\Delta+\gamma}\frac{R_s}{2.45}-0.12
\end{equation}
Makink to calibrate \cite{asce2005asce}
\begin{equation}
ET_0 = f * 0.61 \frac{\Delta}{\Delta+\gamma}\frac{R_s}{2.45}-0.12
\end{equation}
Doorenbos and Pruitt \cite{doorenbos1977crop}
\begin{equation}
ET_0 = c \frac{\Delta}{\Delta+\gamma}\frac{R_s}{2.45}-0.3
\end{equation}
where c is the calibration factor that is a fucntion of rh and ud.
allen and pruitt \cite{allen1991fao}:
\begin{equation}
c = 1.066-0.00128 RH_{mean} + 0.045u_d -0.0002RH{mean}u_d-0.0000315(RH{mean}^2)-0.001103(u_d)^2
\end{equation}
$u_d$ has limits 0 < $u_d$ < 10 ms$^{-1}$.

Hargreaves \cite{hargreaves1982estimating}
\begin{equation}
ET_0 = 0.0023(T_{max}-T_{min})^{0.5}(T_{mean}+17.8) \frac{R_a}{\lambda \rho _w}
\end{equation}
Ra is average daily exoatmospheric radiation(extra terrestrial)
Blaney-Criddle \cite{asce2005asce}

Jensen-Haise \cite{asce2005asce} - ET$_r$ is alfalfa reference ET
\begin{equation}
ET_r = \frac{1}{\lambda} C_r(T-Tx)R_s
\end{equation}
$C_r$ and $T_x$ should be constant for a given area...
Later Jensen defined:
\begin{equation}
C_r = \frac{1}{C_1+C_2C_H}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
C_H = \frac{5}{e_2 + e_1}
\end{equation}
e2 and e1 are the saturation vapor pressures in kPa at the mean daily maximum and mean daily minimum temperatures, respectively, for the average warmest month of the year in an area, and C1 and C2 are constants (C2 = 13 degress F or 7.3 degrees C).
\begin{equation}
C_1 = 38-(2Elev/305)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
T_x = -2.5 - 1.4 (e_2-e_1) - Elev/550
\end{equation}



\subsubsection{Inputs}

$R_n$ net longwave radiation
\begin{equation}
R_nl = f_{cd} (a_1+b_1\sqrt{e_a})\sigma T^4
\end{equation}
if 24-hour or longer time steps...$T^4$ transforms to ($T^4_{max}-T^4_{min}$)/2. \\
$\sigma$ is for daily values 4.901 x 10$^{-9}$ MJm$^{-2}$d$^{-1}$K$^{-4}$ with Rnl in MJm$^{-2}$d$^{-1}$ \\
for hourly calculations $\sigma$ = 2.042 x 10$^{-10}$ MJm2 h$^{-1}$K$^{-4}$, Rnl is in MJm$^{-2}$ h$^{-1}$.

Wright and Jensen \cite{wright1972peak} developed an expression for $f_{cd}$:
\begin{equation}
f_{cd} = a \frac{R_S}{R_{SO}} + b
\end{equation}
a and b are empirical coefficients. General a= 1.3, b=0.3, $a_1$ = 0.39 and $b_1$=0.158

\subsection{Formatting of Mathematical Components}

This is an example of an equation:

\begin{equation}
a + b = c
\end{equation}
%% If the documentclass option "submit" is chosen, please insert a blank line before and after any math environment (equation and eqnarray environments). This ensures correct linenumbering. The blank line should be removed when the documentclass option is changed to "accept" because the text following an equation should not be a new paragraph. 

Please punctuate equations as regular text. Theorem-type environments (including propositions, lemmas, corollaries etc.) can be formatted as follows:
%% Example of a theorem:
\begin{Theorem}
Example text of a theorem.
\end{Theorem}

The text continues here. Proofs must be formatted as follows:

%% Example of a proof:
\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem 1]
Text of the proof. Note that the phrase `of Theorem 1' is optional if it is clear which theorem is being referred to.
\end{proof}

\section{Discussion}

Authors should discuss the results and how they can be interpreted in perspective of previous studies and of the working hypotheses. The findings and their implications should be discussed in the broadest context possible. Future research directions may also be highlighted.

\section{Materials and Methods}

Materials and Methods should be described with sufficient details to allow others to replicate and build on published results. Please note that publication of your manuscript implicates that you must make all materials, data, computer code, and protocols associated with the publication available to readers. Please disclose at the submission stage any restrictions on the availability of materials or information. New methods and protocols should be described in detail while well-established methods can be briefly described and appropriately cited.

Research manuscripts reporting large datasets that are deposited in a publicly available database should specify where the data have been deposited and provide the relevant accession numbers. If the accession numbers have not yet been obtained at the time of submission, please state that they will be provided during review. They must be provided prior to publication.

Interventionary studies involving animals or humans, and other studies require ethical approval must list the authority that provided approval and the corresponding ethical approval code.
