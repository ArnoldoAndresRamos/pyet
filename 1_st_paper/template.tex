\section{Introduction}
\cite{obojes2015vegetation} - higher PET with managed grasslands and \cite{leitinger2015impact}


\section{Evaluation of PET models(Materials and methos)}

\subsection{Previous research}
Sensitivity to erros in potential evapotranspiration input \cite{parmele1972errors}
\cite{parmele1974comparisons} and \cite{mcguinness1972comparison}(z0 = 1 for meadow grass)(details of computation)(Blaney-Criddle-only mean T, Jensen-Hasie \cite{jensen1963estimating}-solar radiation with T) compared 9 PET methods using onsite meteo data
(PEnman with empirical wind function applicable to a short grass with rougness coef of 1cm): 
\cite{andreassian2004impact}-sensitivty of PEnman
\begin{equation}
f(u)=0.35+0.0035*u_2
\end{equation}

Search for best PE formula \cite{jensen1990evapotranspiration}, \cite{xu2002cross}

\subsection{Used PET models}
\cite{xu2002cross} \\
Priestley-Taylor \cite{asce2005asce}
\begin{equation}
E = \frac{\alpha}{\lambda} \frac{\Delta}{\Delta +\gamma}R_{n}
\end{equation}
$\alpha$ = 1.26
\\
Makkink (default) \cite{asce2005asce} \cite{makkink1957testing}
\begin{equation}
ET = 0.61 \frac{\Delta}{\Delta+\gamma} \frac{R_s}{\lambda} -0.12 
\end{equation}
\\
Blaney-Criddle \cite{asce2005asce} \\
\begin{equation}
ET = kp (0.46T_a+8.13) 
\end{equation}
where p = percentage of total daytime hours for the used period (daily or
monthly) out of total daytime hours of the year (365x12);k = monthly consumptive use coefficient, depending on vegetation
type, location and season and for the growing season (May to October),
k varies from 0.5 for orange tree to 1.2 for dense natural
vegetation.
Following the recommendation of Blaney and Criddle (1950)\cite{blaney1950determining}, in the first stage of
the comparative study, values of 0.85 and 0.45 were used for the growing season
(April to September) and the non-growing season (October toMarch), respectively.
\\
Hargreaves \cite{hargreaves1975moisture}\cite{hargreaves1985reference}\cite{hargreaves1982estimating}
\begin{equation}
ET = a(T_{max}-T_{min})^{0.5}(T_{mean}+17.8) \frac{R_a}{\lambda \rho _w}
\end{equation}
a=0.0023 \\
Ra is average daily exoatmospheric radiation(extra terrestrial) \\
\\
FAO PM for reference(potential) evapotranspiration \cite{allen1998crop}
\begin{equation}
ET = \frac{0.408\Delta (R_{n}-G) + \gamma \frac{900}{T_a + 273} U_2 (e_{s}-e_{a})}{\Delta +\gamma (1+0.34u_2)}
\end{equation}
\\
Penman \\
\begin{equation}
E = \frac{1}{\lambda \rho_w} \frac{\Delta (R_{n}-G) + K_u \gamma(a_w+b_wu_2)(e_{s}-e_{a})}{\Delta +\gamma}
\end{equation}
where $a_w$ and $b_w$ are wind function coefficients that are usually receive a local or regional calibration.
Parameter $K_u$ =6.43 for ET in mmd$^{-1}$ and $K_u$ =0.268 for ET in mmhour$^{-1}$.
Penman \cite{penman1963vegetation} used for clipped grass \cite{asce2005asce} $a_w$ = 1.0 and $b_w$ = 0.537, respectively,for wind speed in ms $^{-1}$, $es-ea$ in kPa and grass ETo in mmd$^{-1}$. The equations were intended for use with daily computations. In application of the 1963 Penman, saturation vapor pressure is traditionally based on mean daily air temperature rather than on Tmax and Tmin$"$ \cite{jensen1990evapotranspiration}. \\
\\
Kimberley-Penman \cite{asce2005asce}
\begin{equation}
E = \frac{1}{\lambda \rho_w} \frac{\Delta (R_{n}-G) + K_u \gamma(a_w+b_wu_2)(e_{s}-e_{a})}{\Delta +\gamma} 
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{equation}
a_w = 0.4 + 1.4 exp{-\left[\left(\frac{J-173}{58}\right)^2\right]}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
b_w = 0.605 + 0.345 exp{-\left[\left(\frac{J-243}{80}\right)^2\right]}
\end{equation}
Reference ET FAO with kc for grass\\
\\
Jensen-Haise \cite{asce2005asce} - ET$_r$ is alfalfa reference ET
\begin{equation}
ET_r = \frac{1}{\lambda} C_r(T-Tx)R_s
\end{equation}
$C_r$ and $T_x$ should be constant for a given area...
Later Jensen defined:
"Jensen and Haise (1963) evaluated 3,000 observations of ET as determined by soil sampling procedures over a 35-year period. From about 100 values for well-watered crops with full cover in the western United States, a linear relationship of a solar radiation coefficient and mean air temperature was apparent. From these data, the constants for the following linear equation were CT=0.025 and Tx=-3 for temperature in C. Rs has the same units as $\lambda$ ETr."
\begin{equation}
C_1 = 38-(2Elev/305)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
T_x = -2.5 - 1.4 (e_2-e_1) - Elev/550
\end{equation}
\\
Penman-Monteith \cite{asce2005asce}
\begin{equation}
E = \frac{1}{\lambda} \left[ \frac{\Delta (R_{n}-G)+ K_min \rho_a c_p  (e_{s}-e_{a})/r_{ah}}{\left[ \Delta +\gamma (1+\frac{r_s}{r_{ah}})\right]}\right]
\end{equation}
, where $K_min$ units conversion, equal to 86,400 s d-1 for ET in mm d-1 and equal to 3600 s h-1 for ET in mm h-1.
\begin{equation}
r_a = \frac{ln \left[\frac{z_w-d}{z_{om}}\right]ln \left[\frac{z_h-d}{z_{oh}}\right]}{k^2 u_z}
\end{equation}
where zw = 2, zh = 2, d = 0.67 * h, zom = 0.123*h, zoh = 0.0123*h, k=0.41, u=wind, h=vegetation height
\begin{equation}
r_s = \frac{rl}{LAI_{active}}
\end{equation}
where rl = bulk stomatal resistance of a well-illuminated leaf 100sm-1, and $LAI_{active}$=0.5 LAI. rs=1/gs
\\
Oudin \cite{oudin2005potential}
\begin{equation}
ET = \frac{R_e}{\lambda \rho} \frac{T_a+5}{100}, if T_a + 5 > 0, else ET = 0
\end{equation}
\\
Hamon \cite{oudin2005potential}
\begin{equation}
ET = \left(\frac{DL}{12}\right)^2 exp \left(\frac{T_a}{16}\right)

\subsubsection{Inputs}

$R_n$ net longwave radiation
\begin{equation}
R_nl = f_{cd} (a_1+b_1\sqrt{e_a})\sigma T^4
\end{equation}
if 24-hour or longer time steps...$T^4$ transforms to ($T^4_{max}-T^4_{min}$)/2. \\
$\sigma$ is for daily values 4.901 x 10$^{-9}$ MJm$^{-2}$d$^{-1}$K$^{-4}$ with Rnl in MJm$^{-2}$d$^{-1}$ \\
for hourly calculations $\sigma$ = 2.042 x 10$^{-10}$ MJm2 h$^{-1}$K$^{-4}$, Rnl is in MJm$^{-2}$ h$^{-1}$.

Wright and Jensen \cite{wright1972peak} developed an expression for $f_{cd}$:
\begin{equation}
f_{cd} = a \frac{R_S}{R_{SO}} + b
\end{equation}
a and b are empirical coefficients. General a= 1.3, b=0.3, $a_1$ = 0.39 and $b_1$=0.158

\subsection{Formatting of Mathematical Components}

This is an example of an equation:

\begin{equation}
a + b = c
\end{equation}
%% If the documentclass option "submit" is chosen, please insert a blank line before and after any math environment (equation and eqnarray environments). This ensures correct linenumbering. The blank line should be removed when the documentclass option is changed to "accept" because the text following an equation should not be a new paragraph. 

Please punctuate equations as regular text. Theorem-type environments (including propositions, lemmas, corollaries etc.) can be formatted as follows:
%% Example of a theorem:
\begin{Theorem}
Example text of a theorem.
\end{Theorem}

The text continues here. Proofs must be formatted as follows:

%% Example of a proof:
\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem 1]
Text of the proof. Note that the phrase `of Theorem 1' is optional if it is clear which theorem is being referred to.
\end{proof}
